Destroying the task snapshot is only justified when the server actually answered and disagreed with it
(non-2xx, or a response that would not parse). A transport-level rejection on a waking mobile radio —
"Load failed" / "Failed to fetch" / an offline navigator — proves nothing about the snapshot's contents.

Before this guard, the mount revalidation's `clearOnError` catch ran on those rejections and both blanked
the hydrated board and deleted the cache entry, so the NEXT restore also started empty: a suspension
failure permanently defeated the feature the raised `SWR_TASKS_MAX_AGE_MS` exists to serve. Nine sibling
hooks (useProjects, useNodes, useMeshState, useExecutorStats, useUsageData, useMeshEngines,
useManagedDockerNodes, useProjectHealth) already guard this with the same `visibilitySuspension`
predicate; this reuses it rather than adding a tenth copy.

`navigator.onLine === false` is authoritative for "no request left the device"; `true` is not evidence of
reachability, so the message check still has to run. `lastRefreshErrorAt` is set either way, so the

  stall fields are produced ONLY for review-lane cards — every assignment in `task-store/reads.ts`
  routes through a producer that gates on review itself:

    inReviewStall    getInReviewStallReason      (gates on the review lane)

  So `!task.inReviewStall && !task.inReviewStalled && !task.stalledReview` already means "not a
  review card with a stall badge", and re-asserting the column added nothing a correct board could
  observe.

  WHAT IT DID ADD WAS A BUG, and it is live today rather than pending anything. `inReviewStalled` is
  ALREADY resolved by role, so a renamed board DOES produce that badge — and this literal then
  refused to clear it while a review agent was actively writing logs. The card read "stalled" for
  the whole time work was visibly happening, which is exactly what this function exists to prevent.

  I previously recorded this as a cross-batch coupling that cancelled out and had to be ordered
  against core. That was wrong on one of the three signals: the trait-converted one never cancelled.
  Deleting the check is correct before OR after any core change, and removes the ordering hazard

This is the SOURCE of the planner-activity signal, and it was the narrowest gate of all:
it only stamped `recentAgentActivityAt` for cards literally in `triage`. #2515 removed
that column from the default lineage, so after that merge the stamp never happened for a
default-workflow card — and every consumer downstream (the pulsing Planning badge, the
agent-active row border, the column's executing count) had NO DATA to act on, however
correctly they resolved their own column traits.

Converting the consumers without this would have been cosmetic: they would ask the right
question of a field nothing ever set.

This hook processes SSE and has no resolved column metadata, so the lane is matched by id
against BOTH shapes — pre-merge `triage` and post-merge `todo`. Over-stamping a legacy
hold-lane card is harmless: every consumer additionally requires the column to be an

Resolved traits win; the legacy pair stays as the no-flags fallback, so an unconverted caller and the

FNXC:TaskDetailStateStability 2026-08-05-02:55:
The scheduler can refresh the board while a task-detail host holds a newer queued dependency or
file-overlap snapshot. Providers (SWR, SSE, fetchTaskDetail, and local mutations) do not share an
arrival order, so lifecycle rendering must use the existing timestamp evidence: a later `columnMovedAt`
owns a real column transition; within that column, a later `updatedAt` owns status. Equal or absent
clock evidence retains the already-visible known lifecycle state unless a complete server snapshot is
newer than the row and resolves an equal legacy move clock; sparse SSE patches never receive that tie-break.

This helper intentionally merges only defined sparse fields. A slim or sparse payload's absent, empty, or whitespace-only prompt is not evidence that a loaded plan was cleared, and an empty log is not evidence that a populated journal was cleared; marked full snapshots remain authoritative for both fields. Every open-detail host and useTasks ingestion uses this one boundary so one provider cannot regress a modal, main panel, split detail, dock, or popup independently.

`applyLocalTaskPatch`: FN-5148 requires mismatched ids to be ignored while accepting an absent id, and

  First paint after a mobile tab discard must show the last known board, not an empty one. This
  initializer is the only thing standing between the restore and a blank board, so it hydrates from a
  snapshot that may be hours old (`SWR_TASKS_MAX_AGE_MS`). That is safe only because hydration is
  always paired with revalidation: `isStale` starts true (App renders <TopProgressBar visible> off it)
  and the mount effect below unconditionally issues one `refreshTasks({ clearOnError: true })`.

  FNXC:MobileTabDiscard 2026-07-26-16:40:
  CORRECTION to the sentence this note used to end with ("whose failure branch CLEARS this cache entry
  so a wrong snapshot cannot survive into the next restore"): that is true only of a failure that
  REACHED THE SERVER. A transport-level rejection (suspended tab, offline radio) now leaves the entry
  and the painted rows alone, because it is not evidence the snapshot is wrong — and deleting on it made
  every flaky-radio restore blank, permanently. See the catch branch of `refreshTasks`.

  very first paint. A `useRef` initial value is only honored on first render, which is exactly when the
  `useState` initializer runs — the two stay in lockstep with no effect-ordering gap. Reading the
  timestamp in an effect instead would be wrong: the value returned to consumers is `.current` read

  now — re-creating, through a sibling path, the exact "every in-progress card renders stuck" regression
  the savedAt seeding was added to fix.

  Once a fetch HAS confirmed the board, advancing on a live event stays honest and is deliberately kept:
  the stream reports every task mutation in the project, so a row that produced no event really has not
